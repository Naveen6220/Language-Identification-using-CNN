# Voice Language Identification and Conversion Project

## Overview
This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify four different voice languages. Additionally, it includes functionality to convert the identified voices into the .wav format. The project utilizes Mel spectrogram visualization to enhance the understanding of the audio data.

## Features
1. **Voice Language Identification:** Employing CNN to accurately identify voices in four distinct languages.
2. **Voice Conversion:** Convert identified voices into the widely used .wav format.
3. **Mel Spectrogram Visualization:** Visualize audio data through Mel spectrograms for insightful analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning:** Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks for voice language identification.
- **Data Processing:** Preprocessed and transformed audio data.
- **Visualization:** Employed Mel spectrograms for effective data visualization.
- **Docker:** Containerized the application for seamless deployment and scalability.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Implemented GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD workflows.
- **Cloud Storage:** Utilized AWS S3 for efficient storage of audio data.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Deployed the project on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalability and accessibility.
